### WorkFlow Pipeline project : 

The diagram below  depicts a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) sequence diagram. It outlines a four-step process for building an AI system that They provide dynamic analysis integrated with tailored dashboards, transforming investment **decision-making of Cost margrin**. Let's break down the steps involved :



**Step 1: Define the Most Capable LLM and Locally Run Quantized Model LLM**

* **Goal:** Identify the most suitable large language model (LLM) for the project and configure it to run efficiently on the local hardware.
* **Explanation:** LLMs are AI models trained on massive amounts of text data. They can generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer the questions in an informative way. However, they require significant computing power. In this step, we'll choose an LLM model that balances accuracy and efficiency for running locally on the hardware. Quantization is a technique to reduce the size and computational demands of an LLM model without significantly affecting its accuracy.

**Step 2: Fine-Tune the Model on Specific Data Domain of Chosen Projects Colab Platform**

* **Goal:**  Adapt the LLM to the specific terminology, language, and domain of the Projects Colab Platform's incident data.
* **Explanation:** LLMs are trained on general datasets, **which may not perfectly align with the Projects Colab Platform's specific needs. Fine-tuning involves training the LLM on a more focused dataset related to the Projects Colab Platform's KPIs reports and resolutions.** This helps the LLM become familiar with the specific language used by the Projects Colab Platform and improve its ability to identify relevant patterns and trends.

**Step 3: Define the Pipeline RAG System and Which Suite Vector Database to Use**

* **Goal:**  Design the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system pipeline and select a suitable vector database for storing and retrieving information.
* **Explanation:** RAG systems combine LLMs with information retrieval techniques. In this step, we'll design the pipeline for how the LLM will interact with the retrieval system. Here's a breakdown of the retrieval augmented generation process:
    1. User Query: A user submits a query about a potential incident.
    2. Retrieval: The RAG system retrieves relevant documents from the vector database based on the user query.
    3. Prompt + Retrieved Enhanced Context: The retrieved documents and the user query are then used to create a prompt for the LLM. This prompt provides context to the LLM and helps it generate a more accurate and informative response.
    4. LLM Response Generation: The LLM leverages the prompt to generate a response, such as predicting an incident or proposing solutions.
*  **Vector Database Selection:** we'll also need to choose a vector database to store and efficiently retrieve information for the RAG system. Vector databases use a mathematical approach to represent and search information. They are particularly useful for applications like document retrieval where we need to find similar documents based on their content.

**Step 4: Building UI Interface Interaction Between User and LLM Model Such OpenChat or Chauit**

* **Goal:** Develop a user interface (UI) that allows users to interact with the LLM model. 
* **Explanation:**  In this step, we'll design a user interface where users can submit queries and receive responses from the LLM. This could be a Personalized System Finance interface similar to OpenChat or Chauit, or another type of interface that is best suited for the Projects Colab Platform's needs.

It allows rapid development of interactive interfaces without extensive web development experience. We will utilize Streamlit to build a Personalized System Finance interface for users to interact with the LLM model.
